# Willie's PDQ Stash
This repository is comprised of the projects, automation, and quick fixes I've created during my tenure administering with PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory, to solve problems I've encountered as part of my day-to-day work. They've worked reliably for me, but I recommend performing your due diligence and ensuring they won't negatively impact your environment. Use at your own risk!

All of these packages and collections were developed using an Enterprise version of PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory.

2. Run Windows Updates on comptuers with outdated versions
